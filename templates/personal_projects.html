                        Webscrape is the process of extracting or scraping data from website.
                        In this project, we try to scrap the reviews from Flipkart.com about the product that we are planning to buy. Our end goal is to build a web scraper that collects the reviews of a product from the internet.

                        Machine Learning models are powerful tools to make predictions based on 
                        available data. To make these models useful, they need to be deployed so 
                        that otherâ€™s can easily access them through an API (application programming 
                        interface) to make predictions. A REST API that uses HTTP requests to GET, 
                        PUT, POST and DELETE data.

                        Whenever we used to practice model with small dataset we keep on doing 
                        data visualization from the scratch. It would be waste of time for us 
                        to spend on more data visualizaion. To avoid those things I decided to create 
                        app for basic EDA.

                        Understanding why and when employees are most likely to leave can lead 
                        to actions to improve employee retention as well as possibly planning 
                        new hiring in advance. I will be usign a step-by-step systematic 
                        approach using a method that could be used for a variety of ML problems.

                        Handling Imbalanced Dataset

                        Imbalanced classifications pose a challenge for predictive modeling. This results in models that have poor predictive performance, specifically for the minority class. 
                        Here we discuss some technique to handling this type of problem.
